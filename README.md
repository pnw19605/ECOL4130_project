Final project for Ecological Methodology- Mosquito abundance and chlorophyll-A concentration

Our group hypothesized that as Chlorophyll-a concentration increases, the abundance of mosquitoes will also increase. To test this, we will use NEON data from a nearby aquatic and terrestrial surveying site. Creating a graph of recorded Chlorophyll-A concentrations against mosquito abundance should help reveal any relationship. To further our hypothesis we want to look the trend of how each variable, Chlorophyll-a concentration and mosquito abundance, will vary over time. This would let us determine if there are seasonal trends present due to temperature.
