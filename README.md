Final project for Ecological Methodology- Mosquito abundance and chlorophyll-A concentration

Our group hypothesized that as Chlorophyll-a concentration increases, the abundance of mosquitoes will also increase. To test this, we will use NEON data from a nearby aquatic and terrestrial surveying site. Creating a graph of recorded Chlorophyll-A concentrations against mosquito abundance should help reveal any relationship. To further our hypothesis we want to look the trend of how each variable, Chlorophyll-a concentration and mosquito abundance, will vary over time. This would let us determine if there are seasonal trends present due to temperature. 

The data that is intended to be used for this project is centered in understanding mosquito lifecycles. Mosquitos in larval form live aquatically and before they metamorphosize into their adult forms, they consume many aquatic microbes. These microbes can be quantified by their chlorophyll a content. In addition to the use of chlorophyll a data,  mosquito abundance will be compared from mosquitos captured in CO2 traps. Using this NEON data collected from sites in lake Suggs and Ordway-Swisher biological station, mosquito abundance data can be related to the quality of water. These two major data sets were both downloaded from www.neonscience.org and are readily available for public use. The data is collected monthly and recorded within the NEON database. After making these comparisons and hopefully drawing a correlation between the two variables will help improve public health from mosquito vectored pathogens.
